It is an interactive dashboard where the user can filter by crop and analyze in detail, by the drill-through feature, each province in particular.

- The most exported grain is soybean, followed by corn and last, by far, wheat.
- The most significants provinces involved are:
  + Cordoba

- The quantity exported show some tendency to be low during the summer for Corn and Soybean (summer crops). On the other hand, winter is the worst season for Wheat sales (winter crop).
- Regardless of the crop, the grains price show a tendency to increase as the year progress.
- There is no apparently relationship between the amount sold and the price of the transaction, no matter the procedence location.
