## Context

Welcome to my first Image to Text Project:

Each month one of our biggest company's suppliers send us a list with all of their products and prices updated. The problem is that the list comes in images, through a PDF. The list contains + 75 products with different presentations and prices, and it would be very easy for us to have that information in excel files or SQL tables.

To transcribe manually the data every month is a repetitive and time consuming task so I decided to automate it using Python scripts. Here you will find the [code](https://github.com/astudillojuanm/Personal_Projects/blob/main/PDF%20List%20Image%20to%20Excel/PDF%20Image%20to%20Excel%20File.py) that I wrote to convert the PDF Image into an excel file and [another program](https://github.com/astudillojuanm/Personal_Projects/blob/main/PDF%20List%20Image%20to%20Excel/Coordinates%20App.py) used to find the coordinates where the image had to be cropped.
