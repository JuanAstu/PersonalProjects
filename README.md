## Juan Marcos Astudillo

### Background
Hello!

My name is Juan Marcos Astudillo and welcome to my Project Portfolio. Allow me to introduce myself. I am 6 months away from finishing my degree as an Agriculture Engineer at Universidad de Buenos Aires. Currently I am working as a Purchasing Agent at a big agricultural company and two years ago, bored during the covid pandemic, I came across with my first Python Youtube video. From that moment on, I have been working on personal projects in order to improve my skills and to solve difficult challenges. 

For instance, I implemented SQL querys to explore and transform the information provided by a +1.000.000 sales operations database, and then took that to a PowerBI report to gain more insigths. Additionaly, I built a dashboard at my company in order to measure the efficiency of de Purchasing Department. During my days at work I constantly find myself doing repetitive tasks that are time consuming, so I end up automating them whit Python scripts.

It was an exciting journey from the learning perspective. However, some time ago I made the decision to take it to the next level and that's why I am now transitioning to applied Data Analytics / Science

Feel free to browse through my projects and ask me anything you want!
