## Juan Marcos Astudillo

### Background
Hello!

My name is Juan Marcos Astudillo and welcome to my Project Portfolio! Allow me to introduce myself. 
I am 6 months away from finishing my degree as an Agriculture Engineer at Universidad de Buenos Aires. Currently I am working as a Purchasing Agent at a big agricultural
company and two years ago, bored during the covid pandemic, I came across a MIT's lesson in Youtube about Python. From that moment
on I became more and more interested in the topic, I finished the course 6.0001 "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python"
and I started my own personal Projects focusing on technologies like SQL, PowerBI and Python.

It was an exciting journey from the learning perspective but some time ago I made the decision to take it to the next level and that's why
I am now transitioning to applied Data Analytics / Science and why I am looking for a job that better matches my interests.

Feel free to browse through my projects and ask anything you want, I am a very approachable person!
